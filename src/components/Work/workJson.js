            <br /><br />As a Frontend Software Engineer, I worked closely with stakeholders to transform business
            requirements into an intuitive, fully responsive web application built with React and TypeScript.
            From early architecture planning to final deployment, I ensured the interface was both scalable and
            visually polished across devices. The application’s backend, developed with Node.js and MySQL, was
            optimized for performance and stability, delivering a seamless experience even under heavy usage.


            <br /><br />To enhance functionality, I integrated multiple third-party services and built secure,
            AWS and MongoDB powered application, including RESTful APIs capable of managing over 200K employee records.
            Advanced features such as role-based access control, interactive dashboards, and intelligent search filters
            were implemented, making complex data handling fast and efficient while maintaining a clean and engaging user experience.
